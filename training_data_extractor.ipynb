       "      <th>The Top 5 Most Infamous Narco-Songs. A north Mexico city’s ban on a popular musical group, famous for playing ballads about drug trafficking and violence, is only the latest controversial chapter in the history of the “narcocorrido” genre. On March 12, Chihuahua city issued an indefinite ban on norteño group Los Tigres del Norte playing concerts in the city. The local government said the band violated a city statute which forbids songs that glamorize drug trafficking. Chihuahua is not the first place in Mexico to temporarily prohibit “narcocorridos” — songs about drug traffickers. Last year Sinaloa state, which along with Chihuahua is one of the regions of the country worst affected by Mexico’s drug violence, issued a decree banning the genre. Any bars or clubs that played narcocorridos would lose its liquor license. In the past the city of Tijuana has tried to pass a similar ordinance. The states of Nuevo Leon and Baja California Norte have also enforced bans. Los Tigres del Norte are no strangers to controversy. Their songs take well known figures in the underworld like Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo, Mexico’s most famous drug trafficker in the 1980s, and Sandra Avila Beltran, a female trafficker known as the “Queen of the Pacific,” as their subject matter. In 2009, the group was banned from playing one of their more popular songs, “La Granja,” at a music awards ceremony in Mexico. The video and lyrics are critical of the government’s fight against the drug cartels, using a farm as a metaphor for Mexico, and·animals to represent the main actors. The drug gangs are depicted as an angry Rottweiler, and a fox (an apparent jab at former President Vicente Fox) is depicted as starting all the trouble by letting the dog loose, while pigs in a barn — who may represent Mexico’s elite or the US — are described as happily feasting on corn, only caring about “profits.” Meanwhile, a giant wall is built around the farm, keeping the poor farmers from escaping, a metaphor which needs little explanation. Is “La Granja” a political critique of Mexican drug policy, as Los Tigres del Norte insist, or is it veiled message of support for the criminal groups that are fighting the government, as the authorities have argued? Many other narcocorridos raise similar questions about the line between describing the reality of drug trafficking, and glamorizing or professing support for it. Below are a few of the most notorious and controversial narcocorridos. 1) Angel Gonzalez, “Contrabando y Traicion” Often described as the first narcocorrido, the song was popularized when Los Tigres del Norte recorded a version in 1974. The lyrics tell the story of a woman, Carmelia, who smuggles drugs into the US and then kills her lover. Gonzalez has said that Carmelia is fictional, which has not prevented some women from claiming to be the original inspiration. As the genre developed, many narcocorridos began paying homage to real life traffickers. (See video, below). 2) Tucanes de Tijuana, “El Mas Bravo de los Bravos” A popular young band, the Tucanes de Tijuana recorded several songs that praised Raydel Rosalio Lopez Uriarte, alias “Muletas,” the alleged second-in-command of a faction of the Tijuana Cartel before his arrest in 2010. “El Mas Bravo de los Bravos” (The Toughest of the Tough) is just one of them. The group also wrote a song about Lopez’s boss, Teodoro Garcia Simental, which has only been released online. During a Tijuana concert in August 2010, the group’s frontman stated, “My regards to El Teo and his partner Muletas. Long live the mob!” The incident led Tijuana police chief Julian Leyzaola to ban the group from playing in the city. 3) Valentin Elizade, “A Mis Enemigos” Elizade was killed in 2006 when gunmen ambushed him after a concert in Reynosa. A popular conspiracy theory behind his death involves “A Mis Enemigos” (To My Enemies), which some have interpreted as a challenge to the Zetas, although they are not named in the song. 4) Gerardo Ortiz, “Los Duros de Colombia” With the rise of social networking sites like Myspace and YouTube, narcocorridos steadily gained popularity outside of Mexico’s northern border states. Ortiz’s song, an ode to Pablo Escobar of the Medellin Cartel and the Cali-based Rodriguez brothers, was one of the earliest signs that the genre had gained an international reach. Ortiz later survived an assassination attempt in 2011. 5) Oscar Ovidio, “El Corrido de Juan Ortiz” Guatemalan singer Oscar Ovidio composed this song about the exploits of one of the country’s most notorious drug traffickers, alias “Juan Chamale.” In the late 2000s, as Mexican traffickers steadily gained a foothold in Central America, the narcocorrido was another export that appeared to follow them.</th>\n",

       "      <th>EPL Muscles in on El Naya Drug Corridor in West Colombia. The killing of four people in Jamundí, Valle del Cauca, may have been the EPL’s way of announcing its entrance to one of Colombia’s strategic drug corridors: El Naya. The guerrilla group has increased its presence there recently, creating a possible ticking time bomb for western Colombia. The four people killed — all family members — had their bodies thrown from a truck in Villacolombia, a town in the southern part of the Valle Del Cauca municipality, El Tiempo reported. Though the motives behind the killings remain unclear, authorities are investigating whether the murders were related to score-settling or extortion payments. Though the Popular Liberation Army (Ejército Popular de Liberación – EPL) has long had a presence in the northeastern department of Norte de Santander, along the Venezuela border, a small group of guerrilla fighters appears to have moved into the western part of the country. Since 2017, soldiers in the region have even battled this group of fighters under the EPL banner. The group appears to have 100 men in the sector as they fight for control over the Naya corridor, a route between the departments of Valle del Cauca and Cauca. The latter is one of the major coca-producing regions and is linked by river to the southern Pacific port of Buenaventura, from which shipments of cocaine leave the country for Central America. Besides the small EPL force, other groups are also present in this region: the National Liberation Army (Ejército de Liberación Nacional – ELN), dissident members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia – FARC) members of Mexico’s cartels. They are all fighting to control this key criminal enclave between Naya and Jamundí, where thousands of kilograms of cocaine leave each month. Such a fierce territorial dispute has left the civilian population caught in the crossfire. According to reports from the Army, the EPL’s interest in controlling the drug market in this region is so strong that they are offering $750 (2.5 million pesos) to $950 (3 million pesos) to former FARC members willing to guard coca cultivations and fight the EPL’s principal rivals, the ELN and FARC dissidents. Those two groups, it is believed, have already reached an agreement to take on the EPL forces together. The EPL is strengthening its presence in the Naya corridor for two reasons. The first is that the EPL is fighting the ELN in Norte de Santander where, according to sources, they are likely to be decimated by the larger guerrilla group, because the ELN is stronger and also controls the Venezuelan border region. The EPL appears to be moving into Naya as a way to sustain itself economically. The second is the cost of trafficking drugs along the Venezuelan border, where the EPL must protect the product and transport it by land. Whereas in Naya, the EPL would only need to bring the drug shipments to the ocean port. There, the buyer would be in charge of transport, lessening the costs to the group significantly. The presence of the Mexican cartels could also play an important role, since Colombian groups are often subcontracted by the cartels to send drugs. The EPL would not only be advancing its own interests but also would become yet another player in the cartels’ war in Colombia. In any case, the Naya corridor and western part of the country appear ready to explode in a battle for the control of the cocaine market.</th>\n",

       "   EPL Muscles in on El Naya Drug Corridor in West Colombia. The killing of four people in Jamundí, Valle del Cauca, may have been the EPL’s way of announcing its entrance to one of Colombia’s strategic drug corridors: El Naya. The guerrilla group has increased its presence there recently, creating a possible ticking time bomb for western Colombia. The four people killed — all family members — had their bodies thrown from a truck in Villacolombia, a town in the southern part of the Valle Del Cauca municipality, El Tiempo reported. Though the motives behind the killings remain unclear, authorities are investigating whether the murders were related to score-settling or extortion payments. Though the Popular Liberation Army (Ejército Popular de Liberación – EPL) has long had a presence in the northeastern department of Norte de Santander, along the Venezuela border, a small group of guerrilla fighters appears to have moved into the western part of the country. Since 2017, soldiers in the region have even battled this group of fighters under the EPL banner. The group appears to have 100 men in the sector as they fight for control over the Naya corridor, a route between the departments of Valle del Cauca and Cauca. The latter is one of the major coca-producing regions and is linked by river to the southern Pacific port of Buenaventura, from which shipments of cocaine leave the country for Central America. Besides the small EPL force, other groups are also present in this region: the National Liberation Army (Ejército de Liberación Nacional – ELN), dissident members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia – FARC) members of Mexico’s cartels. They are all fighting to control this key criminal enclave between Naya and Jamundí, where thousands of kilograms of cocaine leave each month. Such a fierce territorial dispute has left the civilian population caught in the crossfire. According to reports from the Army, the EPL’s interest in controlling the drug market in this region is so strong that they are offering $750 (2.5 million pesos) to $950 (3 million pesos) to former FARC members willing to guard coca cultivations and fight the EPL’s principal rivals, the ELN and FARC dissidents. Those two groups, it is believed, have already reached an agreement to take on the EPL forces together. The EPL is strengthening its presence in the Naya corridor for two reasons. The first is that the EPL is fighting the ELN in Norte de Santander where, according to sources, they are likely to be decimated by the larger guerrilla group, because the ELN is stronger and also controls the Venezuelan border region. The EPL appears to be moving into Naya as a way to sustain itself economically. The second is the cost of trafficking drugs along the Venezuelan border, where the EPL must protect the product and transport it by land. Whereas in Naya, the EPL would only need to bring the drug shipments to the ocean port. There, the buyer would be in charge of transport, lessening the costs to the group significantly. The presence of the Mexican cartels could also play an important role, since Colombian groups are often subcontracted by the cartels to send drugs. The EPL would not only be advancing its own interests but also would become yet another player in the cartels’ war in Colombia. In any case, the Naya corridor and western part of the country appear ready to explode in a battle for the control of the cocaine market.   \\\n",
